    \subsection{Room Reservation}
        Room reservation sounds like a very easy task, but ocassionally it can be frustrating as well. As ECE210 Honors is not listed as an offical course, it does not have a offically designated time and location. Therefore, we should aim for time slots that best fit students\rq s schedule to encourage more students to enroll. However, once we have narrowed down to a specific time schedule, sometimes there are few spots available at those times due to time conflicts with discussion sessions of other courses such as ECE220, ECE314, and ECE398. Thus, my suggestion to you is to consider both time and location together when you try to determine the schedule for the upcoming semester.

        Typically this class is conducted in EWS labs, such as ECE2022 and DCL416. These labs have linux machines, which have MATLAB and Jupyter already pre-installed. During Fall 2017, when Kaidong Peng was trying to reserve a time slot among these Linux EWS labs, he had trouble finding one for the reason described above. Thus, he had to look into Windows EWS labs. Through some efforts, he managed to have anaconda installed on all the Windows EWS machines in Engineering Hall 416b1. Anaconda allows students to use Jupyter easily on Windows, and after doing so ECE210 Honors can be conducted in Engineering Hall 416b1 as well. The takeaway is that both Linux and Windows EWS labs are good for ECE210 Honors, but you might have to do some extra work if you choose to have class in Windows EWS labs.

        Now let me give you a very detailed guideline on how to make reservations at ECEB, DCL, or EH. ECEB has its own online reservation system, which can be accessed here via this link: PLACEHOLDER . All you need to do is to log in using your own NetID credentials, and select an available time slot. Make sure you select reoccurent to be the reservation type, and you should be ready to go. For other EWS labs, first check the calendar here to find availabilities. Then access this request form via this link PLACEHOLDER to submit your room reservation request to Engineering IT. The request form is self-explanatory and you should be able to figure out the rest on your own.
